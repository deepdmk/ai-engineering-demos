A deep learning pipeline that classifies aircraft surface damage (dent vs. crack) using transfer learning with VGG16, and generates natural language descriptions using the BLIP transformer model.

## Problem Statement

Manual aircraft inspection is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project automates damage detection using computer vision and adds interpretability through natural language captioning.

## Features

- Binary image classification (dent/crack) using fine-tuned VGG16
- Automated image captioning and summarization with BLIP
- Custom Keras layer for transformer integration
- Training visualization (accuracy/loss curves)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.17.1 torch transformers pillow matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Dataset

Download the [Aircraft Damage Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/youssef-donia-fhktl/aircraft-damage-detection-1j9qk) (CC BY 4.0) and extract to `aircraft_damage_dataset_v1/`.

### Run

Open `vgg16_aircraft_damage_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells.

## Model Architecture

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Base Model** | VGG16 (ImageNet weights, frozen) |
| **Classifier** | Dense(512) → Dropout(0.3) → Dense(512) → Dropout(0.3) → Sigmoid |
| **Captioning** | BLIP (Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) |
| **Optimizer** | Adam (lr=0.0001) |
| **Loss** | Binary Crossentropy |
